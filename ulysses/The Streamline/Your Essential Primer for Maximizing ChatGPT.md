## OpenAI: The Company
[OpenAI](https://openai.com) is an ‚ÄúAI research and deployment company‚Äù with a mission ‚Äúto ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.‚Äù It engineers advanced deep learning models for processing and generating language and imagery.

The company began as a nonprofit in 2015 with Elon Musk among its co-founders. In order to attract funding, it transitioned to a ‚Äúcapped‚Äù for-profit in 2019, with profits limited to 100 times investments and Sam Altman as CEO. Microsoft invested $1 billion, and would add $10 billion in 2023.

Within its new profit model, OpenAI also began commercially licensing its technologies.

### Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs)
GPT is a family of OpenAI LLMs that debuted in 2018. It‚Äôs named for three characteristics that we introduced in [Part 1](https://www.thestreamline.ai/insight/ai-from-a-birds-eye):

- **Generative** ‚Äî Not only do the models interpret language; they generate it.
- **Pre-Trained** ‚Äî The LLMs receive unsupervised training with billions of pages from the web and books. (For their final applications, they‚Äôre often ‚Äúfine-tuned‚Äù through supervised and reinforcement training with custom data.)
- **Transformer** ‚Äî Their transformer architecture boosts accuracy and efficiency by removing, rearranging and assigning weights to words.

### GPTs via API
Initially, GPTs were accessible only via OpenAI‚Äôs **API**. An API (application programing interface) allows apps to integrate with other apps. Virtually all of your apps use APIs. 

In the case of GPTs, third-party apps can communicate with, and fine-tune, the LLMs. That allows developers to create interfaces for the models, or visual mediums for interacting with them, with specialized knowledge. When you see variations of ‚Äúpowered by GPT technology,‚Äù it‚Äôs accomplished using the OpenAI API.

One notable example is [Jasper]()(https://www.jasper.ai/), which generates copywriting for brands.

## Enter ChatGPT
The November 2022 release of ChatGPT gave everyday users a more direct connection to GPTs. Rather than accessing concentrated derivatives of the models through third-party apps, they could go straight to a general-purpose chatbot from OpenAI. That vastly expanded access to GPTs while creating a whole new form of pleasure.

### ChatGPT Snapshot

- ChatGPT is a general-purpose conversational AI, or chatbot, that accepts prompts and returns responses in natural language.
- It‚Äôs not an LLM; rather, it‚Äôs a medium for interacting with OpenAI‚Äôs LLMs. In other words, ChatGPT is an app that offers a visual interface for GPT models, much like Outlook is an interface for emails stored on a server. Some observers call ChatGPT ‚Äúthe eyes and ears of language models.‚Äù *(Stay mindful of this distinction between GPTs‚Äîthe models‚Äîand ChatGPT‚Äîthe chatbot.)*
- On top of their expansive pre-training, GPTs (the models) are fine-tuned for ChatGPT (the chatbot) through (1) supervised learning with sample prompts and responses and (2) reinforcement learning with human monitors. Among other benefits, fine-tuning prepares the tool for common prompts and makes its responses more human-like.
- Initially, ChatGPT relied solely on its training data, which contained no information later than September 2021. That was an enormous limitation, but in May 2023, it gained access to the live web via a plugin that integrates with Microsoft‚Äôs Bing search engine. *(As of June 1, ChatGPT‚Äôs internet access is limited to the web app and rolling out incrementally to users on the free tier.)*
- ChatGPT supports multiple chats. For each each active chat, it recognizes previous prompts and responses, allowing new prompts to build on them.
- The service is free, but for $20/mo., a Plus plan offers guaranteed uptime, faster responses, access to newer GPT models, and early admission to new features.
- ChatGPT remains in the beta phase of development, meaning it‚Äôs vulnerable mistakes, from nuanced misinformation to full-fledged ‚Äúhallucinations.‚Äù Abundant disclaimers reminded users of this experimental phase.

### Access ChatGPT

You can access ChatGPT in two ways:

1. The **web app** on OpenAI‚Äôs website at [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. The **mobile app**, which is currently only available for iOS but coming to Android soon (see my [tour ChatGPT for iOS](https://youtu.be/SfjNdm3CEuM))

You‚Äôll need an OpenAI account, which you can create for free with an email address or by linking an existing account with Apple, Google or Microsoft.

You‚Äôll find the chat interface intuitive, with clear options for entering prompts and creating new chats. Try one of my favorite prompts: `Explain [topic] to a high school student in 500 words`.

Methodical prompting is essential to AI and will remain a core focus of *The Streamline*.

## Experimental Prompts

### Objectives
We‚Äôll dive much deeper into ChatGPT‚Äôs immediate and long-term applications, as well as methodical ‚Äúprompt engineering.‚Äù For your introduction and experimentation, here‚Äôs a quick list of ChatGPT‚Äôs core competencies:

- Explain a given topic
- Outline or draft:
	- Blog posts or essays
	- Social media posts
	- Presentations, sales pitches, taglines, etc.
- Brainstorm names, ideas or themes from a topic or outline
- Given a word, list synonyms, antonyms, rhyming words, et al.
- Predict the outcome for a hypothetical scenario
- Generate a strategy, or detailed instructions, for accomplishing a given objective
- Analyze an existing strategy, such as a business model
- Plan a meal from given ingredients or dietary requirements
- Translate one language to another
- Compose or correct computer code

### Prompt Engineering
With any prompt, you can supply content for ChatGPT to use or reference, such as the content to summarize. You can also specify: 

- **Length**, such as ‚Äú500 words‚Äù
- **Tone**, like ‚Äúin the style of Hemingway‚Äù
- **Target audience**, like ‚Äúa ten-year-old‚Äù
- **Role of the chatbot**, such as an interviewer for a specified role or a specialized therapist
- **Output format**, such as a table or bullet list.

These sorts of prompting strategies are known as ‚Äúprompt engineering.‚Äù

### Sample Prompts
I use variations of the below prompts every day.
- Replace `{}` with your own inputs. 
- Use `[]` as they‚Äôre written. They‚Äôre variables that you define for ChatGPT below the core prompt.

#### Teach me like I‚Äôm in high school.
```
You're an expert on {topic}. I'm in 10th grade. Explain {topic}, 500-word maximum
```

## Explosive Growth

Proponents and skeptics alike describe a sense of magic when using ChatGPT for the first time. Its novelty is undeniable. Its natural conversation, grammatical soundness and conviction are uncanny. It‚Äôs not until you hone in on factual inaccuracies does ChatGPT‚Äôs mystique begin to fade.

Thanks to its sensational first impression, ChatGPT spread like wildfire across news and social media. In just two months, it reached 100 million active users‚Äîa stunning contrast with TikTok (9 months) and Instagram (2.5 years), among other behemoths.

## ChatGPT Plugins

The expiration of ChatGPT‚Äôs knowledge at September 2021 was a conspicuous limitation through its first few months. But in March 2023, OpenAI [announced ChatGPT plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins). Like the extensions available for your web browser, plugins extend the functionality of ChatGPT, typically by connecting it with other services. 

- OpenTable‚Äôs plugin, for example, allows ChatGPT to make up-to-date restaurant recommendations.
- The Kayak plugin provides live pricing for flights, hotels and more.
- You can request real estate listings with the Zillow plugin.

Hundreds of plugins now give ChatGPT access to real-time information from other apps, and the library is growing quickly as OpenAI expands access to developers.

### Browse with Bing
The most notable plugin comes from OpenAI itself rather than a third-party developer. Originally referred to generically as a ‚Äúweb browser,‚Äù it allows ChatGPT to reference the live web.

At its Build conference in May 2023, Microsoft announced that Bing would become ChatGPT‚Äôs default search engine. The plugin was subsequently renamed ‚ÄúSearch with Bing.‚Äù

### Install and Enable Plugins
As of the early summer of 2023, plugins are available only through the ChatGPT web app. I hope they‚Äôre accessible on the mobile apps by the time your read this.

Search with Bing is rolling out to all users, but third-party plugins require a ChatGPT Plus subscription. After toggling to the GPT-4 model, those users will see the option to install and selectively enable plugins.

ChatGPTs access to the internet and other apps are increasingly essential to its use. I‚Äôll dive deep into plugins as _The Streamline_ evolves.

## ChatGPT in Other Apps

Before ChatGPT, developers could build apps that interact with GPT models using OpenAI‚Äôs API.

With ChatGPT, OpenAI expanded its API to allow third-party apps to prompt the chatbot. Every day, new apps are leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT in innovative ways. They typically pair ChatGPT with other technologies and sources of knowledge to expand its capabilities and provide novel solutions to specific needs.

[Slack‚Äôs ChatGPT integration](https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-gpt) uses the expanded API. So does [ChatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/).

![](https://assets.thestreamline.ai/insights/the-chatgpt-revolution/slack-chatgpt.gif)

ChatGPT also inspired a flurry of new GPT integrations (the models, not the chatbot). Chatbots from [Expedia](https://www.expediagroup.com/investors/news-and-events/financial-releases/news/news-details/2023/Chatgpt-Wrote-This-Press-Release--No-It-Didnt-But-It-Can-Now-Assist-With-Travel-Planning-In-The-Expedia-App/default.aspx) and [Duolingo](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/) debuted shortly after ChatGPT.

Apps built on or inspired by ChatGPT are as important to today‚Äôs AI boom as ChatGPT itself. We‚Äôll explore them continuously.
