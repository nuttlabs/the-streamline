# Top-5 Productivity Booster: Manage Gmail Filters in Google Sheets

One of the easiest ways to save time and streamline your workflow is filtering incoming email into folders (or labels, as they’re known in Gmail). That allows you to manage them contextually while keeping your inbox clean.

You might have a label for newsletters, another for financial transactions, and a third for client emails.

With filters, you can specify senders, subject lines and other attributes of emails you’d like to redirect into labels. But as you add more rules, filters become unmanageable within the Gmail interface.

Our filter manager makes it easy to manage your filters in a familiar spreadsheet.
