In many circumstances, you’ll find it helpful to share your conversations with ChatGPT as you collaborate with team members or create content. I’m going to share the best two ways to do that. One is native to ChatGPT; the other is an extension for Google Chrome.

## ChatGPT Shared Links
When a conversation is selected in the sidebar, you’ll see a share icon. Clicking it brings up a module where you can copy a public link to the chat.

- Viewers will only see the conversation up to the point when you created the link. If you continue the conversation afterward, it will remain private unless you regenerate the link.
- Within the module, you can adjust the title that displays above the shared chat.
- You can also click the three dots to include your name or remain anonymous.

Visitors of the link see a page with:

- the title that you may or may not have customized;
- the share date;
- the chat to the point of sharing; and 
- a button to continue the conversation as if it were their own.
