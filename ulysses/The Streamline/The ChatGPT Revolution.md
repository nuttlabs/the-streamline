The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 ignited a revolution in AI. Not only did it offer unrivaled *capability*; it was also profoundly *accessible* and *usable*. As a free, web-based, conversational chatbot, ChatGDP placed an unimaginably powerful technology in the hands of everyday people. And it was‚Äîand remains‚Äîa mere preview of the disruptive force it, and the applications it inspires, will become.

### How we‚Äôll unpack ChatGPT üëá

- OpenAI: The Company

\<!-- /TOC --\> 

## OpenAI: The Company
[OpenAI](https://openai.com) is an ‚ÄúAI research and deployment company‚Äù with a mission ‚Äúto ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.‚Äù It engineers advanced deep learning models for processing and generating language and imagery.

The company began as a nonprofit in 2015 with Elon Musk among its co-founders. In order to attract funding, it transitioned to a ‚Äúcapped‚Äù for-profit in 2019, with profits limited to 100 times investments and Sam Altman as CEO. Microsoft invested $1 billion, and would add $10 billion in 2023.

Within its new profit model, OpenAI also began commercially licensing its technologies.

### Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs)
GPT is a family of OpenAI LLMs that debuted in 2018. It‚Äôs named for three characteristics that we introduced in [Part 1](https://www.thestreamline.ai/insight/ai-from-a-birds-eye):

- **Generative** ‚Äî Not only do the models interpret language; they generate it.
- **Pre-Trained** ‚Äî The LLMs receive unsupervised training with billions of pages from the web and books. (For their final applications, they‚Äôre often ‚Äúfine-tuned‚Äù through supervised and reinforcement training with custom data.)
- **Transformer** ‚Äî Their transformer architecture boosts accuracy and efficiency by removing, rearranging and assigning weights to words.

### GPTs via API
Initially, GPTs were accessible only via OpenAI‚Äôs **API**. An API (application programing interface) allows apps to integrate with other apps. Virtually all of your apps use APIs. 

In the case of GPTs, third-party apps can communicate with, and fine-tune, the LLMs. That allows developers to create interfaces for the models, or visual mediums for interacting with them, with specialized knowledge. When you see variations of ‚Äúpowered by GPT technology,‚Äù it‚Äôs accomplished using the OpenAI API.

One notable example is [Jasper]()(https://www.jasper.ai/), which generates copywriting for brands.

## Enter ChatGPT
The November 2022 release of ChatGPT gave everyday users a more direct connection to GPTs. Rather than accessing concentrated derivatives of the models through third-party apps, they could go straight to a general-purpose chatbot from OpenAI. That vastly expanded access to GPTs while creating a whole new form of pleasure.

### ChatGPT Snapshot

- ChatGPT is a general-purpose conversational AI, or chatbot, that accepts prompts and returns responses in natural language.
- It‚Äôs not an LLM; rather, it‚Äôs a medium for interacting with OpenAI‚Äôs LLMs. In other words, ChatGPT is an app that offers a visual interface for GPT models, much like Outlook is an interface for emails stored on a server. Some observers call ChatGPT ‚Äúthe eyes and ears of language models.‚Äù *(Stay mindful of this distinction between GPTs‚Äîthe models‚Äîand ChatGPT‚Äîthe chatbot.)*
- On top of their expansive pre-training, GPTs (the models) are fine-tuned for ChatGPT (the chatbot) through (1) supervised learning with sample prompts and responses and (2) reinforcement learning with human monitors. Among other benefits, fine-tuning prepares the tool for common prompts and makes its responses more human-like.
- Initially, ChatGPT relied solely on its training data, which contained no information later than September 2021. That was an enormous limitation, but in May 2023, it gained access to the live web via a plugin that integrates with Microsoft‚Äôs Bing search engine. *(As of June 1, ChatGPT‚Äôs internet access is limited to the web app and rolling out incrementally to users on the free tier.)*
- ChatGPT supports multiple chats. For each each active chat, it recognizes previous prompts and responses, allowing new prompts to build on them.
- The service is free, but for $20/mo., a Plus plan offers guaranteed uptime, faster responses, access to newer GPT models, and early admission to new features.
- ChatGPT remains in the beta phase of development, meaning it‚Äôs vulnerable mistakes, from nuanced misinformation to full-fledged ‚Äúhallucinations.‚Äù Abundant disclaimers reminded users of this experimental phase.

### Access ChatGPT

You can access ChatGPT in two ways:

1. The **web app** on OpenAI‚Äôs website at [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. The **mobile app**, which is currently only available for iOS but coming to Android soon (see my [tour ChatGPT for iOS](https://youtu.be/SfjNdm3CEuM))

You‚Äôll need an OpenAI account, which you can create for free with an email address or by linking an existing account with Apple, Google or Microsoft.

You‚Äôll find the chat interface intuitive, with clear options for entering prompts and creating new chats. Try one of my favorite prompts: `Explain [topic] to a high school student in 500 words`.
