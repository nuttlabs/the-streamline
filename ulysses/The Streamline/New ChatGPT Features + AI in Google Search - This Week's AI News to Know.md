- Prompt examples at the beginning of new chats, as well as suggested follow-up prompts
- Upload multiple files
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Plus users will default to the latest GPT model

### Google is expanding AI features in Search.

- While itâ€™s AI chatbot Bard garners most of the attention, Google is slowly adding AI features to standard Search through a feature called Search Generative Experience (SGE).
- Recently Google [expanded SGE](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23817107/google-ai-search-generative-experience-videos-links) to offer multimedia results, linked and dated references, and faster performance.
- Personal Google accounts that donâ€™t use Google Workspace can enable SGE in [Search Labs](https://labs.google.com/search/experiments).

### GPT-5â€™s trademark offers a glimpse of new features.
OpenAI [applied to trademark GPT-5](https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-trademark-gpt-5), which would succeed its current top LLM, GPT-4. The filing suggests that the model will offer:

- Speech recognition and transcription
- Text-to-speech
- Downloadable computer programs
- Creation of AI models

### Google is empowering Assistant and physical robots with new AI models.

- As an everyday user of voice assistants, Iâ€™m discouraged by their lack of progress and thrilled that Google is [reinvigorating Assistant](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-assistant-is-about-to-get-supercharged-by-generative-ai-says-new-report/) with new generative AI.
- With the changes, Google is restructuring the Assistant team, which indicates a commitment to a better direction for the product.
- Meanwhile, Google also [announced a new model](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/28/23811109/google-smart-robot-generative-ai) called Robotic Transformer, or RT-2, which will strengthen the intelligence of physical robots, including their ability to interpret instructions and make decisions.
