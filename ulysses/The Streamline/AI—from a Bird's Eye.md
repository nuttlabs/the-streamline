## AI—from a Bird’s Eye
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a discipline within computer science that broadly refers to the ability of computers to mimic human cognitive functions, especially reasoning, perception and learning. That empowers them to perform tasks commonly believed to require the human mind, such as interpreting and generating language and multimedia.

I like to think of AI as technology that learns to perform functions without explicit programing by engineers. Rather than humans defining each step for processing information, the system develops its own model through **machine learning**.

### AI IRL
AI manifests in many forms throughout your daily life:

- Web search engines, like Google
- Voice assistants, like Alexa and Siri
- Recommendation engines, like suggested content on YouTube, Netflix and Twitter
- Auto-completed emails and search queries
- Transcribed meetings and voicemails
- Facial recognition systems, like Apple’s Face ID
- Autonomous vehicles, like those from Waymo and Tesla

*Google Search’s auto-complete is an AI most of us encounter every day.*

If you’re a digital content creator, you also see a growing number of AI tools for composing and editing text, audio, images and video.

### Inputs → Outputs (I/O)
Notwithstanding its form or function, AI always accepts **input values** and returns **output values** (I/O). Depending on the application, those inputs and outputs could be:

- text, such as written human or programming language;
- audio, such as spoken language or music;
- imagery or video; or
- mathematical or binary data.

In some cases, the output triggers an action, such as slamming the breaks of an autonomous vehicle.

### AI Systems = Prediction Models
An AI’s output represents its best prediction for the answers sought by the inputs. Fundamentally, **AI systems are prediction models**, which develop from patterns and relationships in “training” data.

*Netflix’s recommendation engine **predicts** which programs you’ll like.*

### From Science Fiction to Revolution
Artificial intelligence became an academic discipline in the mid-1950s, but for more than a half-century, it penetrated mainstream conversations mostly through fictional portrayals.

That changed in 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, which offered groundbreaking advancements in the **capability** and **accessibility** of AI.

Let's unpack a few subfields of AI that will help make sense of today’s AI phenomenon.

## General vs. Narrow Intelligence

### Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
The AI we encounter today is Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), also known as “weak AI." It solves a single problem by performing narrowly defined, structured functions that result from human engineering. That includes web searches and content recommendations.

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), or “strong AI,” is an aspirational level of AI, where a computer’s intelligence matches a human’s and can be applied across domains. We’re not there; it’s a goal of the AI community.

AGI may also be self-aware, but some technologists reserve that trait for **artificial superintelligence (ASI)**.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is the ability of AI to learn from its operations and improve performance over time, without explicit programing.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning powered by a neural network. 

### Neural Network
An artificial neural network (ANN) is a layered network of nodes simulating connected neurons in the human brain. Each node plays a unique role in the collective algorithm, allowing the system to analyze and generate data at high volumes and efficiency.

![Artificial Neural Network](https://assets.thestreamline.ai/insights/ai-from-a-birds-eye/the-streamline_ai-from-a-birds-eye_neural-network.png)

Through “training,” the neural network forms the AI model.

### Training
AI systems form a **model** by finding patterns and relationships in **training** data. 

Training typically occurs through one or more of these core methods:

#### Supervised Learning
Within supervised learning, the dataset is pre-labeled, such as images containing a cat or dog. The AI system is given the full dataset, including the classifications, from which it learns to map inputs (pet photos) to desired outputs (pet types).

#### Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the dataset is unlabeled and often massive. The AI detects patterns and relationships unrecognized by human engineers, such as patterns in natural language.

#### Reinforcement Learning
With reinforcement learning, AI systems learn through trial and error. Each action is rewarded or penalized, either manually or algorithmically, depending on the goal. Over time, the AI learns to maximize rewards. Recommendation engines use reinforcement learning: Watching recommended programs rewards Netflix’s algorithm.

As Netflix demonstrates, many AIs continue learning when deployed.

## Generative AI
Generative AI is a class of AI that produces content, such as text, images, audio or video. Given a prompt, it predicts the requested outcome using the model formed from supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning.

In March 2023, an AI-generated photo Pope Francis in a puffy coat overtook (and fooled) the web.

The following April, a song generated with the voices of Drake and The Weeknd caused an even greater stir:

\</audio\>
The auto-complete features in Gmail and Google Search are generative AI that you likely encounter frequently.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing is a type of AI that interprets, and often generates, natural human language. Depending on the application, language is accepted and returned as text or audio.

Spell checkers, translators and chatbots employ language processing.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
As you now know, neural networks that have trained and deployed are known as **models**. For language processors, those models are known as **large language models (LLMs)**. 

LLMs usually train through unsupervised learning (unlabeled data), with massive datasets that can comprise billions of pages from the web and digitized books.

If AI systems are prediction models, then LLMs, as [Gary Marcus put it](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1FKNTwpRkjcYmKDcj8QmTf?si=d5d3c98bc71e4580), “are auto-complete on steroids.”

### Transformers
Transformer-based LLMs boost comprehension and operational efficiency by eliminating, rearranging and assigning weights to words. The architecture was discovered by engineers at Google in 2017, setting the stage for today’s AI boom.

## Impact of AI
As a nerdy, nascent technophile, I learned that a technology’s capability correlates with its potential good, but also its potential for evil. As technology advances, it can solve more problems or cause greater destruction. It was true for splitting the atom. It was true for the internet. And it’s perhaps most true for AI.

The imminent impact of AI can’t be overstated. Bill Gates [describes it best](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun):

> The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.

In the coming tutorials, we’ll employ the concepts above to understand ChatGPT, its contemporaries and this revolutionary moment for AI. As you encounter them, I encourage you to revisit this guide to reinforce your understanding.

As we unpack AI, we’ll explore the opportunities, the threats, and actionable tactics for leveraging these emerging technologies personally and professionally.
