### Meta and Microsoft launched an open-source AI model.
- In a surprising partnership, Microsoft and Meta jointly launched Llama 2, a [large language model (LLM)](https://www.thestreamline.ai/insight/ai-from-a-birds-eye) that rivals [OpenAI's GPTs](https://www.thestreamline.ai/insight/your-essential-primer-for-maximizing-chatgpt).
- Notably, the model is open-source, meaning developers and companies can use it freely for research and commercial purposes. 
- While this eliminates a revenue stream enjoyed by OpenAI, Google and other rivals that charge for their LLMs, open-sourcing allows Meta to crowdsource improvements to the model.
