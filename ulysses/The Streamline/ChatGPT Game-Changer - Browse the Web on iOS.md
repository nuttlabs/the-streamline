The release of ChatGPT ignited a revolution in AI, but for its first six months, its knowledge ended at September 2021. That was a highly consequential limitation as competitors emerged with access to the live web, including Microsoft’s new Bing and Bard from Google.

Then OpenAI announced Browse with Bing for ChatGPT, which unleashed a world of new possibilities with the leading general purpose AI chatbot. But the feature was only available through OpenAI’s website. The app for iPhone and iPad debuted without access to the web.

But in a major development this week, subscribers to the $20/mo. ChatGPT Plus can now Browse with Bing from the iOS app.

- Within **Settings**, under **New Features**, you can toggle **Browse with Bing**.
- Then when you choose the GPT-4 model, you can switch to **Browse with Bing**.

Try asking it to summarize an article: `Summarize this: [URL]`

If you find the option unavailable under **Settings**, try deleting the app and reinstalling it. That will force an update.
