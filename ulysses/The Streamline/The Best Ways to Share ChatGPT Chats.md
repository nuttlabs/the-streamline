In many circumstances, you’ll find it helpful to share your conversations with ChatGPT as you collaborate with team members or create content. I’m going to share the best two ways to do that. One is native to ChatGPT; the other is an extension for web browsers.

## ChatGPT Shared Links
When a conversation is selected in the sidebar, you’ll see a share icon. Clicking it brings up a module where you can copy a public link to the chat.

- Viewers will only see the conversation up to the point when you created the link. If you continue the conversation afterward, it will remain private unless you regenerate the link.
- Within the module, you can adjust the title that displays above the shared chat.
- You can also click the three dots to include your name or remain anonymous.

Visitors of the link see a page with:

- the title that you may or may not have customized;
- the share date;
- the chat to the point of sharing; and 
- a button to continue the conversation as if it were their own.

To delete the public link, click the share icon to reopen the module and choose to “delete this link.”

## Awesome Screenshot

The other sharing method captures a screenshot of the chat through a Chrome extension called [Awesome Screenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-chatgpt-screensho/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj). I already used Awesome Screenshot often for full-page page screenshots and recordings, and with ChatGPT, it becomes even more useful by adding a “Screenshot” button above the prompt box that looks native to ChatGPT.

When you click the button, it creates an image of the full chat that you can share with a link or download.

I’ve found this feature to work best with the sidebar collapsed.
