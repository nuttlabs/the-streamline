**Ahoy.** Here are the AI stories you need to know from the past week, curated with care by yours truly. For this week‚Äôs video version, I used a new voice cloner (more on that below). Once you‚Äôre up to speed, spend some time with this ChatGPT demo that demonstrates a few of my core principles of prompt engineering. ü¶æ

### ElevenLabs debuted its voice generator.
- [The release](https://elevenlabs.io/) was hotly anticipated after realistic deepfakes went viral during its beta stage.
- I used the technology to clone my voice for [this week‚Äôs video](https://youtu.be/tTe6dVr-sC8). It‚Äôs more natural than [last week‚Äôs](https://youtu.be/9R6WZhKH5b0) but sounds less like me.
- As voice cloning gets more realistic, it presents applications and opportunities for every business. I‚Äôll cover it deeply and continually.

### Meta advanced AI translation and coding.
- [SeamlessM4T](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/seamlessm4t-ai-translation-model/) can translate more than 100 languages via speech-to-text, speech-to-speech, text-to-speech or text-to-text.
- [Code Llama](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/) is a state-of-the-art AI for generating and discussing computer code with developers.
- _William‚Äôs take:_ After its whiff on the metaverse, Meta has cemented itself as a major force in AI.

### YouTube partnered with Universal Music Group.
- Through a new Music AI Incubator, YouTube will collaborate with artists to develop generative AI technologies and gather insights.
- The partnership aims to boost innovation while avoiding copyright risks.
- YouTube CEO Neal Mohan outlined [three core principles](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/partnering-with-the-music-industry-on-ai) that will drive the company‚Äôs approach to AI.

### Midjourney added ‚ÄúVary (Region).‚Äù
- Known as Generative Fill in Photoshop and ‚Äúinpainting‚Äù in other apps,  [the feature](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/vary-region) allows users to specify a region to modify.
- Midjourney is the enduring leader among photo generators.

### Access Microsoft Designer in Edge.
- The tool accepts text prompts to generate designs with images, text and design elements. (Think promotions and invitations.)
- It also uses OpenAI‚Äôs DALL-E model to generate images.
- _William‚Äôs take:_ There are better design tools (read: Canva and Adobe Express), but with Bing Chat also readily available in Edge, I‚Äôm using the browser more often and inclined to tinker with Designer more frequently.
