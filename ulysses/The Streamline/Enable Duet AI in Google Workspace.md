Duet AI for Google Workspace adds AI as a “real-time collaborator” to Docs, Gmail, Meet and other Google apps. You can think of it as Google’s version of Microsoft Copilot. With the ability to reference your information across the Google ecosystem, Duet can perform tasks like summarizing documents, creating presentations, taking notes in meetings and drafting emails.

With any Google Workspace subscription, administrators can enable a free trial of Duet, after which it’s $30 per month, per user:

1. In the sidebar of your Admin Console, choose **Subscriptions** under Billing.
2. Select **Add or upgrade a subscription**, then **Google Workspace add-ons**.
3. Within Duet AI, click **Start Free Trial** and follow the straightforward steps that follow.
4. Then you need to assign the licenses to users: Within **Users**, use the checkboxes to select users to receive access to Duet.
5. Click **Assign licenses** above the list and choose **Duet AI for Google Workspace Enterprise**, then **Assign**.

When those users sign in to apps that support Duet, they’ll see an introductory prompt.
