## Microsoft’s Big Bet

Way back in 2019, when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, we knew it was bullish on generative AI. When it added $10 billion to that investment in early 2023, shortly after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Microsoft bet its future on AI. The company has since infused AI into its ecosystem of products that fuel global enterprises.

## The New Bing

For everyday users, Microsoft’s AI first appeared in February 2023 with the [relaunch of Bing](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/), the comically unpopular alternative to Google Search. The new Bing began a shift from traditional search engines that listed relevant websites to conversational chatbots, like ChatGPT with access to the Web. _(At the time, ChatGPT relied on its training data, which concluded at September 2021.)_

As a part of Microsoft’s close relationship with OpenAI, Bing’s conversational AI is powered in part by GPT models, as well as Microsoft’s proprietary [Prometheus model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/prometheus-microsoft-research/).

In addition to accessing real-time information, Bing could return rich media, including photos, videos and charts. It also offered an interface for structuring your prompts, with visual inputs for specifying the tone, format and length of the generated response.

### Access the New Bing

From a computer, access the new Bing from Microsoft’s [Edge web browser]()(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download). On mobile devices, download the Bing app for [iOS]()(https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bing-your-ai-copilot/id345323231) or [Android]()(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details). Sign in with your Microsoft account (create one if necessary), then look for the chat icon:

### Starter Prompts

- Serve it the same prompts you provided ChatGPT earlier in this series. Compare their responses.
- Try others that utilize Bing’s connection to the internet, such as summarizing today’s news for a category, or analyzing the sentiment of a story.
- Ask it about yourself: ***************”Who is [Full Name]()”?***************

## Copilot On-Demand

Shortly following Bing’s relaunch, Microsoft [teased Copilot]()(https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/), an AI assistant that would become ubiquitous throughout Microsoft’s ecosystem of products. Copilot would make its way to:

- the 365 apps used by virtually every business, including Excel, Word, Outlook and OneNote;
- the Windows operating system;
- Github, Azure and other apps for designers, developers and IT specialists;
- the Teams collaboration platform; and
- the Edge web browser, where Bing’s AI chatbot would ultimately assume the Copilot identity.

Wherever it’s summoned, among a multitude of capabilities, Copilot would be able to:

- draft emails, project plans or presentations;
- analyze spreadsheets or other data;
- summarize emails, meetings or documents;
- format Excel or Word documents;
- translate written or spoken language; and
- schedule meetings that suit everyone’s calendar.

And all along, Copilot would have access to your calendar, contacts, documents and other information for reference or to make updates.

### Incremental Rollout

When Microsoft announced Copilot in March, it was in testing with a small selection of enterprise 365 users.

In June, that testing pool expanded to about 600 customers, and analysts anticipated a few more months of testing before Copilot’s public beta. If it remains unavailable when you read this guide, I’ll notify *[The Streamline]()(https://thestreamline.ai)* subscribers as soon as it opens.

## Designer

[Microsoft Designer]()(https://designer.microsoft.com) is a standalone AI-powered application that generates graphics from a text prompt for social media posts, digital invitations, thumbnails, and other needs for combining text and images.

Honestly, I’m underwhelmed by its outputs, but they can serve as a helpful foundation for images you finalize with heavy editing.

Within your text prompt, you can specify:

- where the image will be used (e.g., "social media graphic" or “YouTube thumbnail”);
- the topic (e.g., ”promoting live jazz”);
- specific copy to include (e.g., “Live Jazz July 23");
- the subjects of photos to include (e.g., ”with a photo of a saxophone"); and
- a tone or mood (e.g., ”luxurious").

You can also upload a specific photo to include.

Designer generates a handful of variations, from which you can choose one to customize.

### Designer in Edge

In addition to the web version of Designer at designer.microsoft.com, you can add it to the Edge web browser for quick access alongside the chatbot.

### Photo Generator

Designer also includes a photo generator powered by OpenAI’s DALL·E model. You can generate a photo, then use it in your design.

I cover prompt engineering for photo generators extensively in other resources.
