Let's boost your expertise in ChatGPT and AI overall. Drawing from my core principles of prompt engineering, we'll craft a prompt for a family whoâ€™s concerned about their father, and they need advice for how to approach him. 

First, we'll assign a role to ChatGPT:

`You're a family therapist.`

Then we'll provide high-level context for our circumstance and our goal. In doing so, we'll be succinct and we'll use a variable as a placeholder for details we'll provide at the end of the prompt:

`My mother, my sister and I are concerned about my father for [Reasons].`

Then we'll give ChatGPT a specific assignment with a clear objective:

`Provide guidance for approaching him with compassion, in a way that encourages change without undermining the love and respect we hold for him.
`
At the end, we'll define that variable. We'll supply more detailed context that points ChatGPT in the right direction and minimizes uncertainty:

```
Reaons:
- My father dresses in oversized clothing. His shorts extend well below his knees. His shirts nearly reach his knees. His short sleeves extend below his elbows. 
- As a consequence of his carless attire, friends and extended family are losing respect for my father and laughing at his expense. 
- The oversized clothing is a manifestation of a broader issue, where stress and low self esteem leave my father unmotivated to present himself with dignity.
```

And with that methodical prompt, ChatGPT, as usual, provides an insightful and useful response that beautifully fulfills its objective:
