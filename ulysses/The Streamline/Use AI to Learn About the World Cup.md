One of my favorite uses of AI is to compile information from disparate sources into a clean and comprehensible table.

In light of the ongoing World Cup, I wanted to learn about the players on the U.S. Women’s National Team. And while Microsoft’s Bing can also reference the live web, I knew that Google’s Bard could include photos in tables. So I provided Bard with this prompt:

```
You're a sports journalist. Create a table. Each row is a player of the U.S. Women's National team. Include these columns:

- "Hometown": Where the player was born
- "College": Where the player attended college
- "Fun fact": A true, interesting, unique fact about the player, written as one sentence
- "Photo": A photo of the player
- "More info": A link to a bio page for the player
```
  
I was quite pleased with the results:

And of course, the same prompt could be used to learn about any team playing in the World Cup.

For those needing a refresher on how the World Cup Works, including its various stages, ChatGPT is a great option since the content isn’t recent. Here’s an effective prompt:

```
“You're a sports journalist. Explain how the world cup works. Include each stage. 50-word limit. Your audience is a teenager.”
```

And the satisfying results:
