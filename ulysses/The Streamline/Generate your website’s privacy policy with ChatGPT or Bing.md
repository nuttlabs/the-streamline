# Generate your website’s privacy policy with ChatGPT or Bing

\<!-- youTube(wQ6UQPRvEEE) --\>

Every website needs a privacy policy. It satisfies legal requirements and relieves growing concerns among users about data protection. With a few of my principles of prompt engineering, you can generate your privacy policy in a snap with ChatGPT or Bing.

#### Role Play
As always, begin by assigning a role to the chatbot: 

`You're a lawyer.`

#### Assignment
Issue an assignment:

`Write a privacy policy for my website...` 

#### Objective
Declare the objective:

`...that satisfies all legal requirements in [COUNTRIES/CONTINENTS].`


#### Procedure
Explain how to collect the required information:

`Ask me for the information you need, one question at a time.`

_This is where Bard fails. Despite the contrary instruction, it issues all questions at onece._

## Result
With that principled prompt, ChatGPT or Bing will ask a series of questions about your website, then generate a standard privacy policy that’s suitable for most websites:

## Optional Iteration
If you want to add an extra bulletproof layer, you can iterate on the result by asking the chatbot to identify any holes:

`Analyze the privacy policy above to identify any ommitted legal requirements.`
